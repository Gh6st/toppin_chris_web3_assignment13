            <h2>Affordances</h2>
              <p>Affordances as the name implies, afford you to do something if you can. It is the relationship between the user and the object. If the features of the object and the capabilities of the user align, it affords that user to do the task.
              </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
              <p>My example for affordances is a hook hanger. The upward curve of the hooks affords/indicates that someone can hang things here.
              </p>

          <h2>Signifiers</h2>
            <p>Signifiers are perceivable signs that let a user know what actions can be taken, how, where, and when through the sensory senses.
            </p>
          <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>The lightbar on the device is an example of a signifier that displays the status of the device. Red indicates that the device is locked and that someone can not enter unless the signifier turns green. When the lightbar is green, that signifies the device is unlocked, and you can enter freely.
            </p>

              <h2>Mappings</h2>
                <p>I think mapping is the relationship between controls and the objects/actions that they control.
                </p>

              <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>To unlock this door, you have to scan your card. The scanner is next to the door it controls. It is an exceptional example of indirect mapping but also layout mapping.
                </p>
