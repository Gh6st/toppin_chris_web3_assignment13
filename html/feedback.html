          <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>Feedback for me is when someone can tell that they or the product have completed or failed a task through sensory information.
            </p>
          <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>This snapshot is a good form of feedback. After submitting my payment for my credit card, I received an email letting me know that the bank has received my payment, a simple but effective form of feedback. It removes any worry that a user might have if their payment was received successfully or not.
            </p>
